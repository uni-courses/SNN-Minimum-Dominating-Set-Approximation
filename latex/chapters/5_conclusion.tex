\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
% Talk about results.
The results presented in \cref{sec:results}, along with their critical context described in \cref{sec:discussion} are to be synthesised in this section to provide a clear insight into the benefits and drawbacks of leveraging implementations inspired by principles of brain adaptation in neuromorphic hardware to increase the radiation robustness of these architectures in space applications.
