\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
% Talk about results.
%The results presented in \cref{sec:results}, along with their critical context described in \cref{sec:discussion} are to be synthesised in this section to provide a clear insight into the benefits and drawbacks of leveraging implementations inspired by principles of brain adaptation in neuromorphic hardware to increase the radiation robustness of these architectures in space applications.
% Talk about discussion
% Mention whether or not it helped.
Brain-inspired adaptation mechanisms may be used in SNN implementations of graph optimisation problems to increase the radiation robustness of neuromorphic space hardware if SEE propagations can lead to neuron death. Creating more intelligent adaptation mechanisms than separate redundant neuronal pathways for each neuron may improve the radiation results at a lower neuronal overhead. 

% Don't mention that symmetries in distributed algorithms may also be leveraged in lowering the cost of these brain adaptations. Not a conclusion, not mentioned before, not related to this work.

% TODO: write something about overhead and spike energy.
