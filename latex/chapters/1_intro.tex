\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Space exploration poses several challenges. Launching material into orbit is still expensive, and once in space, the environment can be harsh due to extreme temperatures, a vacuum and radiation. On top of that, deep space missions have to deal with increasing communication delays with greater distances from Earth. Neuromorphic engineering is a field that can yield applications and use-cases in the domain of space exploration to overcome some of these challenges. The spiking neural networks used in neuromorphic architectures have been shown to obtain significant increases in energy efficiency in AI applications \cite{}\cite{}%https://redwood.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Davies2018.pdf. 
This increase in energy efficiency of typical AI solutions, may render the application of neuromorphic hardware in space applications a viable option to increase the autonomy of robotic deep space exploration missions. By increasing the autonomy of such space robots, their respective rate of exploration may be increased as they have to wait less on decisions made human mission control back on Earth. This interest in neuromorphic space application has led to research to assess the impact of radiation on neuromorphic space hardware \cite{cantley_impact_2021,roffe_neutron-induced_2021}. Furthermore, research is being performed to increase the fault-tolerance of neuromorphic hardware \cite{tran_design_2011} and into the radiation robustness of neuromorphic hardware for aerospace applications \cite{vaz_cmos_2020}. This research sets out to take a bio-inspired approach to increasing the radiation robustness of neuromorphic space hardware. It presents a spiking neural network implementation inspired by the principle of brain adaptation on neuromorphic hardware, which is tested for radiation robustness in a simulation of radiation exposure as experienced in a (deep) space missions. \Cref{sec:methodology} presents the Von Neumann and neuromorphic implementations of the minimum dominating set approximation algorithm, and the brain adaptation implementations. Additionally, it presents the experiment setup and approach to simulate orbit radiation exposure. The simulation results and measured radiation robustness are presented in \cref{sec:results}. \Cref{sec:discussion} interprets the impact of these results, and aims to sketch how well the simulation applies to real radiation exposure conditions of neuromorphic hardware. \cref{sec:conclusion} summarises the research and indicates whether the chosen implementation of brain adaptation principles is succesfull at increasing the radiation robustness and at what cost such changes are realised.\Cref{sec:recommendations} provides suggestions on how to build upon this work with future research.
