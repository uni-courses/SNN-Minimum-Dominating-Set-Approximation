\section{Recommendations}\label{sec:recommendations}
\textit{Recommendations may be generated based on the listed issues in \cref{sec:discussion}. It is foreseeable that dedicated shielding and or redundancy of critical elements of traditional Von Neumann elements in neuromorphic architectures may be advisable, whilst relying on the brain-inspired implementations in the spiking neural networks. Another recommendation that may flow out of this research may concern the integration of brain adaptation principles into the design of spiking neural network implementations that yield space application functionalities. Furthermore, a recommendation may be generated regarding a proposed shift in the moment of training, from pre-trained on the ground, to (re-)training after radiation exposure.}
